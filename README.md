### Reducing File/Folder sizes

The skeleton model I have import was around 30mb in size. But I found that blender offers a decimate modiefier which reduces the amount of faces/vertices to reduce the size of model.  
Deleted a large amount of autosaves and crash folder which added upto 10mb of data.  
Converted final animation video from 1920x1080 avi of about 1.1gb to 1280x720 mp4 of size 16mb using mp4 (mpeg4) compression.
