## Coursework Scene

Low Poly Future Desert scene where humans have long perished and robots from far far away visit the remains of a once full of life planet.

##### Models created

The four main models I have created are: 
1.  Human like Robot (Wall-F) --> Complex robot that I have made using mirror modifier since the robot is symmetrical and has a lot of details.
2.  UFO --> Used simple UV spheres and added subdivision modifers and smooth shading to create the UFO look.
3.  Simple Robot (Wall-B) --> Simple model of a pyramid-shaped robot inspired from the show love,death + robots.
4.  Cactus and Desert Plane

##### Materials and Textures
For each model I have separately created materials adding different colors. I have also made use of ***emission*** properties for UFO lights and ***glass*** material for reflection from the UFO cockpit. I have used textures and hdri's for some models and the environment and have added them in the materials section under assets.

**Textures**
1.  I have tried multiple different textures for the desert sand plane after browsing through blenderkit, polligon and polyhaven websites and decided to use the procedural sand texture that looks pretty amazing when rendered in cycles.
2.  I have used a metallic material with less roughness for Wall-F (1). Also created black eyes and mouth for the screen.
3.  Added cactus texture image for cactus material.

**Environment**
1.  Used a desert grand canyon HDRI (2) for the environment lighting and UFO reflection

##### Lights

I have imported the mountain (3), tent (3) and the skull (4) models from below links.
