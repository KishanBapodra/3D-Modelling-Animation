## Coursework Scene

#### Low Poly Desert scene set in the future where humans have long perished and robots from far away visit the remains of a once full of life planet to investigate and explore their origin planet.

### Models created

The four main models I have created are: 
1.  **Human like Robot (Wall-F)** --> Complex robot that I have made using mirror modifier since the robot is symmetrical and has a lot of details.
2.  **UFO** --> Used simple UV spheres and added subdivision modifers and smooth shading. To create the UFO look I used proportional editing and raised the center of UFO.
3.  **Simple Robot (Wall-B)** --> Simple model of a pyramid-shaped robot inspired from the show love,death + robots.
4.  **Cactus and Desert Plane**

### Materials and Textures
For each model I have separately created materials adding different colors. I have also made use of ***emission*** material property for UFO lights and ***glass*** material for reflection from the UFO cockpit. I have used textures and hdri's for some models and the environment and have added them in the materials section under assets.

**Textures**
1.  I have tried multiple different textures for the desert sand plane after browsing through blenderkit, polligon and polyhaven websites and decided to use the ***procedural sand texture*** that looks pretty amazing when rendered in cycles.
2.  I have used a ***metallic material*** with less roughness for Wall-F (1). Also created black eyes and mouth for the screen.
3.  Added cactus ***texture image*** for cactus material.

**Environment**
1.  Used a ***Desert grand canyon HDRI*** (2) for the environment lighting and UFO reflection

### Lights
I have used a simple **point light** to create a *night scene*. I have placed the light to give proper shading to make the scene look more realistic as lighting can play a big role in accentuating all models characteristics. I have also used lighting in the UFO by adding material with emissive property for the UFO.

### Composition
I have placed the two robots near the UFO as they are exploring the remains of a planet together. Added tents and skull to give a feel of deserted land that has long been abandoned. Added cactus for a more detailed environment as small details can bring a scene together.


I have imported the mountain (3), tent (3) and the skull (4) models from below links.
